Submissions are evaluated on sum of the normalized area of the square bounding box for each puzzle. For each `n`-tree configuration, the side `s` of square box bounding the trees is squared and divided by the total number `n` of trees in the configuration. The final score is the sum of all configurations. Refer to the [metric notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/metric/santa-2025-metric) for exact implementation details.

$$ \text{score} = \sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{s_{n}^2}{n}$$

## Submission File
For each `id` in the submission (representing a single tree in a `n`-tree configuration), you must report the tree position given by `x`, `y`, and the rotation given by `deg`. To avoid loss of precision when saving and reading the files, the values must be converted to a string and prepended with an `s` before submission. Submissions with any overlapping trees will throw an error. To avoid extreme leaderboard scores, location values must be constrained to \\(-100 \le x, y \le 100\\).

The file should contain a header and have the following format:

    id,x,y,deg
    001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299
    002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299
    002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348
    etc.
