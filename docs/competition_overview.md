_Right to your front door! _ <br>
_Santa has tree toys, tiny tree toys,_ <br>
_To mail from shore to shore._ <br>
_He needs the smallest box, indeed a square box,_<br>
_To fit them all inside,_<br>
_So he can mail these stocking stuffers_<br>
_On his big long Christmas ride!_ <br>

_Here comes the problem, here comes the problem._<br>
_We need the smallest size!_<br>
_For one to two hundred trees in shipments,_<br>
_We need your expert eyes._<br> 
_Can you find the best solution to help us pack_<br> 
_All the tiny trees inside?_<br>
_We must find the optimal packing to help Santa Claus_<br> 
_And win a prize!_<br>


**The Challenge**

In this re-defined optimization problem, help Santa fit Christmas tree toys into the smallest (2-dimension) parcel size possible so that he can efficiently mail these stocking stuffers around the globe. Santa needs the dimensions of the smallest possible square box that fits shipments of between 1-200 trees. 

**The Goal**

Find the optimal packing solution to help Santa this season and win Rudolph's attention by being one of the first to post your solution! 

Happy packing!
