COMPETITION-SPECIFIC RULES \nIn addition to the provisions of the General Competition Rules below, you understand and agree to these Competition-Specific Rules required by the Competition Sponsor:\n\n####1. TEAM LIMITS\na. The maximum Team size is five (5).</h5>\nb. Team mergers are allowed and can be performed by the Team leader. In order to merge, the combined Team must have a total Submission count less than or equal to the maximum allowed as of the Team Merger Deadline. The maximum allowed is the number of Submissions per day multiplied by the number of days the competition has been running.</h5>\n\n####2. SUBMISSION LIMITS\na. You may submit a maximum of 100 entries per day.</h5>\nb. You may select up to two (2) Final Submissions for judging.</h5>\n\n####3. COMPETITION TIMELINE\na. Competition Timeline dates (including Entry Deadline, Final Submission Deadline, Start Date, and Team Merger Deadline, as applicable) are reflected on the competition\u2019s Overview > Timeline page.</h5>\n\n####4. COMPETITION DATA\n\na. Data Access and Use.</h5>\n\n1. You may access and use the Competition Data for any purpose, whether commercial or non-commercial, including for participating in the Competition and on Kaggle.com forums, and for academic research and education. The Competition Sponsor reserves the right to disqualify any Participant who uses the Competition Data other than as permitted by the Competition Website and these Rules.</h6>\n\nb. Data Security. </h5>\n\n1. You agree to use reasonable and suitable measures to prevent persons who have not formally agreed to these Rules from gaining access to the Competition Data. You agree not to transmit, duplicate, publish, redistribute or otherwise provide or make available the Competition Data to any party not participating in the Competition. You agree to notify Kaggle immediately upon learning of any possible unauthorized transmission of or unauthorized access to the Competition Data and agree to work with Kaggle to rectify any unauthorized transmission or access.</h6>\n\n####5. WINNER LICENSE \n\na. Under Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations) of the General Rules below, you hereby grant and will grant the Competition Sponsor the following license(s) with respect to your Submission if you are a Competition winner:</h5>\n\n*Open Source*: You hereby license and will license your winning Submission and the source code used to generate the Submission under an Open Source Initiative-approved license (see [www.opensource.org] (http://www.opensource.org)) that in no event limits commercial use of such code or model containing or depending on such code. </h6>\n\nb. You may be required by the Sponsor to provide a detailed description of how the winning Submission was generated, to the Competition Sponsor\u2019s specifications, as outlined in Section 2.8, Winner\u2019s Obligations. This may include a detailed description of methodology, where one must be able to reproduce the approach by reading the description, and includes a detailed explanation of the architecture, preprocessing, loss function, training details, hyper-parameters, etc. The description should also include a link to a code repository with complete and detailed instructions so that the results obtained can be reproduced.</h7>\n \n####6. EXTERNAL DATA AND TOOLS\n\na. You may use data other than the Competition Data (\u201cExternal Data\u201d) to develop and test your Submissions. However, you will ensure the External Data is either publicly available and equally accessible to use by all Participants of the Competition for purposes of the competition at no cost to the other Participants, or satisfies the Reasonableness criteria as outlined in Section 2.6.b below. The ability to use External Data under this Section does not limit your other obligations under these Competition Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations). </h5>\n\nb. The use of external data and models is acceptable unless specifically prohibited by the Host. Because of the potential costs or restrictions (e.g., \u201cgeo restrictions\u201d) associated with obtaining rights to use external data or certain software and associated tools, their use must be \u201creasonably accessible to all\u201d and of \u201cminimal cost\u201d. Also, regardless of the cost challenges as they might affect all Participants during the course of the competition, the costs of potentially procuring a license for software used to generate a Submission, must also be considered. The Host will employ an assessment of whether or not the following criteria can exclude the use of the particular LLM, data set(s), or tool(s):</h5>\n\n1. Are Participants being excluded from a competition because of the \"excessive\" costs for access to certain LLMs, external data, or tools that might be used by other Participants. The Host will assess the excessive cost concern by applying a \u201cReasonableness\u201d standard (the \u201cReasonableness Standard\u201d). The Reasonableness Standard will be determined and applied by the Host in light of things like cost thresholds and accessibility.</h6>\n\n2. By way of example only, a small subscription charge to use additional elements of a large language model such as Gemini Advanced are acceptable if meeting the Reasonableness Standard of Sec. 8.2. Purchasing a license to use a proprietary dataset that exceeds the cost of a prize in the competition would not be considered reasonable.</h6>\n\nc. Automated Machine Learning Tools (\u201cAMLT\u201d)</h5>\n\n1. Individual Participants and Teams may use automated machine learning tool(s) (\u201cAMLT\u201d) (e.g., Google toML, H2O Driverless AI, etc.) to create a Submission, provided that the Participant or Team ensures that they have an appropriate license to the AMLT such that they are able to comply with the Competition Rules. </h6>\n\n####7. ELIGIBILITY\n\na. Unless otherwise stated in the Competition-Specific Rules above or prohibited by internal policies of the Competition Entities, employees, interns, contractors, officers and directors of Competition Entities may enter and participate in the Competition, but are not eligible to win any Prizes. \"Competition Entities\" means the Competition Sponsor, Kaggle Inc., and their respective parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliates. If you are such a Participant from a Competition Entity, you are subject to all applicable internal policies of your employer with respect to your participation.</h5>\n\n####8. WINNER\u2019S OBLIGATIONS\n\na. As a condition to being awarded a Prize, a Prize winner must fulfill the following obligations:</h5>\n\n1. Deliver to the Competition Sponsor the final model's software code as used to generate the winning Submission and associated documentation. The delivered software code should follow [these documentation guidelines][5], must be capable of generating the winning Submission, and contain a description of resources required to build and/or run the executable code successfully. For avoidance of doubt, delivered software code should include training code, inference code, and a description of the required computational environment. \n\na. To the extent that the final model\u2019s software code includes generally commercially available software that is not owned by you, but that can be procured by the Competition Sponsor without undue expense, then instead of delivering the code for that software to the Competition Sponsor, you must identify that software, method for procuring it, and any parameters or other information necessary to replicate the winning Submission; Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner\u2019s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules, including but not limited to Section 2.5 (Winners License), Section 2.8 (Winners Obligations), and Section 3.14 (Warranty, Indemnity, and Release).\u201d </h6>\n\nb. Individual Participants and Teams who create a Submission using an AMLT may win a Prize. However, for clarity, the potential winner\u2019s Submission must still meet the requirements of these Rules,</h6>\n\n2. Grant to the Competition Sponsor the license to the winning Submission stated in the Competition Specific Rules above, and represent that you have the unrestricted right to grant that license;</h6>\n\n3. Sign and return all Prize acceptance documents as may be required by Competition Sponsor or Kaggle, including without limitation: (a) eligibility certifications; (b) licenses, releases and other agreements required under the Rules; and (c) U.S. tax forms (such as IRS Form W-9 if U.S. resident, IRS Form W-8BEN if foreign resident, or future equivalents).</h6>\n\n####9. GOVERNING LAW\n\na. Unless otherwise provided in the Competition Specific Rules above, all claims arising out of or relating to these Rules will be governed by California law, excluding its conflict of laws rules, and will be litigated exclusively in the Federal or State courts of Santa Clara County, California, USA. The parties consent to personal jurisdiction in those courts. If any provision of these Rules is held to be invalid or unenforceable, all remaining provisions of the Rules will remain in full force and effect.</h5>\n\n###3.

For each `n`-tree configuration, the side `s` of square box bounding the trees is squared and divided by the total number `n` of trees in the configuration. The final score is the sum of all configurations. Refer to the [metric notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/metric/santa-2025-metric) for exact implementation details.\n\n$$ \\text{score} = \\sum_{n=1}^{N} \\frac{s_{n}^2}{n}$$\n\n## Submission File\nFor each `id` in the submission (representing a single tree in a `n`-tree configuration), you must report the tree position given by `x`, `y`, and the rotation given by `deg`. To avoid loss of precision when saving and reading the files, the values must be converted to a string and prepended with an `s` before submission. Submissions with any overlapping trees will throw an error. To avoid extreme leaderboard scores, location values must be constrained to \\\\(-100 \\le x, y \\le 100\\\\).\n\nThe file should contain a header and have the following format:\n\n    id,x,y,deg\n    001_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n    002_0,s0.0,s0.0,s20.411299\n    002_1,s-0.541068,s0.259317,s51.66348\n    etc.",
