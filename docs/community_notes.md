## Tactical takeaways (title-based only)
- Small-n focus: the small-number strategy thread likely contains ideas to test early; small n can dominate score per tree.
- Lattice packing + sawtooth barrier: suggests structured layouts for mid/high n (N>=58) could be key.
- Exact algorithm: hints at deterministic optimization methods worth checking (MIP/CP or geometric exact).
- bbox3 / top kernels: likely precomputed layouts or cached bounding boxes; inspect kernels for reusable data.
- Collision and touching: re-verify metric semantics; touching is allowed, overlaps are not.
- best-of-per-n: aligns with our pooling strategy; continue per-n best-of submissions.
- Interactive Editor: useful for manual tweaks or visual debugging.
